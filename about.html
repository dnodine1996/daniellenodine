				<h2>About</h2>
				<div id="about">
					<p>Hi, I'm Marisa. I own and operate Mobile Dog and Cat Grooming. I've been a groomer for about 15 years. I've owned two different brick and mortar shops in the Inland Empire. In the last couple of years I've concentrated on serving that brand of customer that prefers the personal touch for their pet. All of my grooming is done out of a specially designed van that contains the same plumbing, electrical and environmental functions you would normally see in a traditional grooming salon. The difference is, I come to you instead of you coming to me. This convenience and safe environment has worked really well for my customers and their pets.</p>
					<p>My philosophy in this business is to build a relationship with the owner as well as the pet. Some of my clients have been with me so long they're on their second or third dog! I value that kind of relationship - this isn't just a job for me; I really like what I do. It's not only the grooming but the way people react when they see my work. I'm very proud of what I do and I'm sure you'll be delighted with the results.</p>
