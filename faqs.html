						<dt>Why choose a mobile groomer?</dt>
					<p> </p>

Your pet will receive one on one attention!  No need for two trips to the salon anymore!  Both you and your pet will enjoy the convenience of mobile pet grooming!</dd>
					<p>
					</p>
						<dt>Is all the grooming done in the van?</dt>
					<p> </p>
						<dd>Yes, the vans are fully self-sufficient and equipped with a generator, air-conditioning, heater, bathtub, grooming table and all the necessary equipment to provide a complete grooming service totally within the van.</dd>
					<p>
					</p>
						<dt>How long does the grooming take?</dt>
					<p> </p>
						<dd>The average appointment takes about 60 minutes to 90 minutes to complete. This can vary depending on the breed, condition and length of coat, procedure required, temperament of the animal, etc.</dd>
					<p>
					</p>
						<dt>How far in advance do I need to schedule an appointment?</dt>
					<p> </p>
						<dd>Quite often we can book your appointment within 2-3 days. However, there are times during the year which become very busy and it is recommended to schedule as far as 2 or more weeks ahead.</dd>
					<p>
					</p>
						<dt>How often should my pet be groomed?</dt>
					<p> </p>
						<dd>n general a grooming every 4-6 weeks is recommended. The frequency varies on a per animal basis depending on breed and coat type. It is good for your pet to be groomed and/or bathed before becoming overly dirty or matted.</dd>
					<p>
					</p>
						<dt>Should my dog have the anal glands expressed with each grooming?</dt>
					<p> </p>
						<dd>Our groomers will check the anal glands as part of the regular grooming service and will only express them if needed. Animals naturally express these glands during normal everyday functions and they should not be hand manipulated unless necessary as this may cause irritation or infection. If the glands cannot be easily expressed by the groomer, or are swollen, we will recommend the animal be taken to a vet.</dd>
					<p>
					</p>
						<dt>Why is shaving down more expensive than a hair cut?</dt>
					<p> </p>
						<dd>In many cases the animal is matted, has extremely thick hair, is excessively dirty or has other conditions which make shaving not only more difficult than a hair cut, but usually necessary. Stripping, especially a dirty, matted coat, also subjects clippers and blades to unusual wear and tear which can be costly to maintain or replace. In addition, great care and extra time is required in an effort to shave the coat evenly and avoid cutting the skin with the clippers.</dd>
					<p>
					</p>
						<dt>My pet has a lot of mats, is it necessary to shave them out?</dt>
					<p> </p>
						<dd>It depends on the severity of the matting. Minor mats can sometimes be worked out, but many times shaving down or stripping is necessary. Severe mats can cause skin irritations and hide other conditions such as hot spots, dermatitis, seborrhea, cuts, scabs, sores and redness. It is not unusual to encounter these problems when the coat is stripped from a badly matted animal and it is definitely in your pets best interest to address them</dd>

					<p>Your pets grooming experience is important to us. Our goal is for your pet to have a pleasant, stress-free grooming session.</p>
